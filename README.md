## Lambda app

Contains the answers for this [test](https://github.com/zbsz/test_app)

## Features

1. Lazy loading messages (All downloaded messages are logged in the app)
2. Functions to persist/cache messages in database(inside db package)  
3. Delete messages(mark as deleted from db)  

## Note

My Ideas was to develop this test app with scala. But due to my limited time and heavy work load I couldn't able to do that. 
[Macroid](http://macroid.github.io/) is a good library to integrate android with scala. Main thing I wanted to do is 
trying out [akka on android](http://macroid.github.io/modules/Akka.html)
